# Setting Up a Next.js Project 
 
- Setting up a Next.js project is straightforward, thanks to the `create-next-app` command, which simplifies the creation process by setting up the essential project structure and installing dependencies automatically.

## Key Steps in Setting Up a Next.js Project: 
**1. Installing Node.js and npm/yarn**  
- **Node.js**  is the runtime required for running JavaScript outside the browser, and **npm**  (Node Package Manager) comes bundled with Node.js. Alternatively, you can use **yarn** , an alternative package manager. 
  - **Install Node.js**  from the [official website]() .
 
  - Verify the installation by running the following commands in your terminal:


```Copy code
node -v
npm -v
```

You should see the installed versions of Node.js and npm.
If you prefer using **yarn** , install it by running:

```Copy code
npm install --global yarn
```

Verify the yarn installation:


```Copy code
yarn -v
```

# Setting Up a Next.js Project

Verify the yarn installation:

```
2. Running `create-next-app`**  
- **`create-next-app`**  is a utility provided by Next.js to quickly scaffold a Next.js project. It installs all the required dependencies and sets up the folder structure. 
  - Run the following command in your terminal:


```Copy code
npx create-next-app my-next-project
```
Alternatively, if you use **yarn** , you can run:

```Copy code
yarn create next-app my-next-project
```

After running the command, you will be prompted to name your project. Once the setup is complete, navigate to the project folder:


```Copy code
cd my-next-project
```
 
- To start the development server, run:


```Copy code
npm run dev
```
Or with **yarn** :

```Copy code
yarn dev
```
This will start the development server, and your app will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
**3. Understanding Project Structure** 
Once the project is created, the default folder structure will look like this:


```Copy code
my-next-project/
├── node_modules/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.ico
├── pages/
│   ├── _app.js
│   ├── api/
│   │   └── hello.js
│   └── index.js
├── styles/
│   ├── globals.css
│   └── Home.module.css
├── .gitignore
├── package.json
└── README.md
```
 
- **`pages/`** : This directory is where your routes are defined. Every file in this directory becomes a route. For example, `pages/index.js` maps to the `/` route. 
  - **Example** : 
    - `pages/index.js` → `http://localhost:3000/`
 
    - `pages/about.js` → `http://localhost:3000/about`
 
- **`public/`** : This folder contains static files such as images, icons, and other assets. Files placed here can be directly accessed via the browser (e.g., `public/logo.png` will be available at `http://localhost:3000/logo.png`).
 
- **`styles/`** : Contains CSS files for styling. The default project includes a `globals.css` for global styles and `Home.module.css` for component-scoped styles.
 
- **`package.json`** : This file lists your project dependencies and scripts, such as `dev`, `build`, and `start`.
 
- **`node_modules/`** : Stores the installed dependencies required for the project to run.

Once you understand this structure, you can start building your app by adding pages, components, and styling!
